This program allows a user to search a database for the first and last name and
phone number of the entries listed in the phones.txt file. The program accepts a
user input, then converts that input into lower case so that the program can cross
reference the text file and print out any line that contains the input by <first_name>
<last_name>, <phone_number>. Finally the program checks to see wether or not the user
wishes to restart and run another search or quit the program entirely.

Input: The name or phone number that is to be searched, as well as wether or not to
restart the program.

Output: Any line in the text document that matches the user's search query in the format
of <first_name> <last_name>, <phone_number>.
